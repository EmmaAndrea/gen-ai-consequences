    <h2>five reasons why</h2>
    <h1>GenAI <br> is <b>BAD</b> for the <br> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <br> and <b>PEOPLE</b></h1>
    
    <div class="five_reasons">
        <div style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
            <b>1. Electricity Consumption</b> <br> 
            If GenAI was a country, it would be <b>fifth</b> place on the global list of energy consumption, between <b>Japan</b> and <b>Russia</b>. 
            <br> <br> This level of energy consumption cannot be met with <b>green</b> energy.
            <br> <br> It is estimated that training a single model like OpenAI's GPT-3 requires 1,287 megawatt hours of electricity (enough to power about 120 average U.S. homes for a year).
            <br> <br>That amount of energy generates approximately 552 tons of carbon dioxide.

        <div style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
            <b>2. Water Consumption</b><br>
            One prompt requires approximately <b>0.5 - 1 liter</b> chilled water for cooling.

        <div style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
            <b>3. Toxic Chemicals for GPU</b><br>
            Powerful processors called GPUs are used to handle intensive GenAI workloads.
            <br> <br>The production of these processors is incredibly harmful for the environment.

        <div style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
            <b>4. Digital Sweatshops</b><br>
            Think AI knows how to categorize information instinctually? Think again. <br>
            
            <br> Human workers are needed to sort through the training material. They label, tag, transcribe and process data. <br>
            Due to the high demand, this work is increasingly being outsourced to workers in the Global South. <br>
            <br>These humans often work in what is known as "digital sweatshops". Here, they consistently report poor working conditions, exploitation, and forms of psychological distress. <br>
            <br> A working day in these locations can often last up to 20 hours, during which the workers will shift through approximately 1000 cases.
            <br> <br>Understanding these data sets requires human, contextual understanding. This means humans sometimes interact with toxic, graphic and hateful content under already distressful and exploitative working conditions. <br>

            <b>5. Making the Rich Richer and the Poor Poorer</b><br>
            The godfather of AI, Geoffrey Hinton, stated that "AI will make a few people much richer, but most people poorer" [6]<br> <br>
            The impact of AI on the global income distribution is highly uncertain. However, most predictions suggest it will increase inequality, both within-countries and between-countries. <br> <br>
            It is predicted that AI will benefit highly skilled workers, and replace low-skilled jobs and repetitive tasks. Wealth will be concentrated among those who control the technology. <br> <br>
            Catch-up growth of developing countries is threatened by AI. Because developing countries may not be able harness AI's benefits orm mitigate its disruptions, they will again fall far behind.
