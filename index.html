    <h2>five reasons why</h2>
    <h1>GenAI <br> is <b>BAD</b> for the <br> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <br> and <b>PEOPLE</b></h1>
    
    <div class ="page"></div>
    <div class="five_reasons">
        <div style="margin-bottom: 5%; margin-top: 10%;">
            <h3>1. Electricity Consumption</h3>
            If GenAI was a country, it would be <b>fifth</b> place on the global list of energy consumption, between <b>Japan</b> and <b>Russia</b>. 
            <br> <br> This level of energy consumption cannot be met with <b>green</b> energy.
            <br> <br> A single model, like OpenAI's GPT-3 requires ~1,287 MWh of electricity to train.

        <div style="margin-bottom: 5%;">
            <h3>2. Water Consumption</h3>
            A single prompt requires around <b>0.5 - 1 liter</b> chilled water for cooling of data centers. <br> <br>
            The global AI demand in <b>2027</b> is projected to account for <b>30-47 million</b> people's <b>yearly</b> water consumption, just to cool the data centers. 
        </div>
        <div style="margin-bottom: 5%;">
            <h3>3. Toxic Chemicals for GPU</h3>
            Thousands of GPUs are needed to run the AI models.
            <br> <br> The production of these processors is incredibly harmful for the environment, especially due to the sourcing of materials.
        </div>
        <div style="margin-bottom: 5%;">
            <h3>4. Digital Sweatshops</h3>
            Think AI knows how to categorize information instinctually? Think again.
            
            <br> Human workers are needed to sort through the training material. They label, tag, transcribe and process data. <br>
            Due to the high demand, this work is increasingly being outsourced to workers in the Global South. <br>
            <br>These humans often work in what is known as "digital sweatshops". Here, they consistently report poor working conditions, exploitation, and forms of psychological distress. <br>
            <br> A working day in these locations can often last up to 20 hours, during which the workers will shift through approximately 1000 cases.
            <br> <br>Understanding these data sets requires human, contextual understanding. This means humans sometimes interact with toxic, graphic and hateful content under already distressful and exploitative working conditions. <br>

            <h3>5. Making the Rich Richer and the Poor Poorer</h3>
            The godfather of AI, Geoffrey Hinton, stated that "AI will make a few people much richer, but most people poorer" [6]<br> <br>
            The impact of AI on the global income distribution is highly uncertain. However, most predictions suggest it will increase inequality, both within-countries and between-countries. <br> <br>
            It is predicted that AI will benefit highly skilled workers, and replace low-skilled jobs and repetitive tasks. Wealth will be concentrated among those who control the technology. <br> <br>
            Catch-up growth of developing countries is threatened by AI. Because developing countries may not be able harness AI's benefits or mitigate its disruptions, they may again fall far behind.
