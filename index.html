    <h2>5 reasons why</h2>
    <h1>GenAI is <b>BAD</b> <br> for the <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> and <b>PEOPLE</b></h1>
    
    <div class="five_reasons">
        <div>
            <b>1. Electricity Consumption</b> <br> 
            If GenAI was a country, it would be fifth place on the global list of energy consumption, between Japan and Russia. 
            <p>"By 2026, the electricity consumption of data centers is expected to approach 1,050 terawatt-hours" says Noman Bashir. [1]</p>
            This level of energy consumption cannot be met with green energy.
            <p>“The demand for new data centers cannot be met in a sustainable way. The pace at which companies are building new data centers means the bulk of the electricity to power them must come from fossil fuel-based power plants,” [1]</p>
            It is estimated that training a single model like OpenAI's GPT-3 requires 1,287 megawatt hours of electricity (enough to power about 120 average U.S. homes for a year).
            <br> That amount of energy generates approximately 552 tons of carbon dioxide.
            <p>"While all machine-learning models must be trained, one issue unique to generative AI is the rapid fluctuations in energy use that occur over different phases of the training process, Bashir explains. Power grid operators must have a way to absorb those fluctuations to protect the grid, and they usually employ diesel-based generators for that task." [1]</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <b>2. Water Consumption</b><br>
            One prompt requires approximately 0.5 - 1 liter chilled water for cooling.
            <p> The average query, Altman wrote, uses 0.34 watt-hours of energy. [2]</p>
            <p> Chilled water is used to cool a data center by absorbing heat from computing equipment. It has been estimated that, for each kilowatt hour of energy a data center consumes, it would need two liters of water for cooling, says Bashir. [1]</p>
            <p>“Just because this is called "cloud computing" doesn't mean the hardware lives in the cloud. Data centers are present in our physical world, and because of their water usage they have direct and indirect implications for biodiversity,” Bashir says. [1]</p>

        <div>
            <b>3. Toxic Chemicals for GPU</b><br>
            Powerful processors called GPUs are used to handle intensive GenAI workloads.
            The production of these processors is incredibly harmful for the environment.
            <p>The total number of GPUs sold for the second quarter of 2025 hit 11.6 million units. This is a 27% increase in graphics card shipments. [9]</p>
            <p>As for the three major GPU manufacturers, Nvidia still has the lead, taking in 94% of the market [9]</p>
            <p>Assessing the cradle-to-gate environmental impact distribution across the GPU components reveals that the GPU chip is the largest contributor across 10 of 16 of impact categories and shows particularly pronounced contributions to climate change (81\%) and resource use, fossils (80\%). [8]</p> 
            <p>Market research firm TechInsights estimates that the three major producers (NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel) shipped 3.85 million GPUs to data centers in 2023, up from about 2.67 million in 2022. That number is expected to have increased by an even greater percentage in 2024. [1]</p>
        </div>
        <div style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
            <b>4. Digital Sweatshops</b><br>
            Think AI knows how to categorize information instinctually? Think again. <br>
            Human workers are needed to sort through the training material. They label, tag, transcribe and process data. <br>
            Due to the high demand, this work is increasingly being outsourced to workers in the Global South <br>
            <p>The World Bank estimates there are between 150 and 430 million data laborers whose work ultimately drives cutting-edge technological development. [3] </p>
            These humans often work in what is known as "digital sweatshops". Here, they consistently report poor working conditions, exploitation, and forms of psychological distress. <br>
            A working day in these locations can often last up to 20 hours, during which the workers will shift through approximately 1000 cases.
            <p>Annotated data sets are used to train AI models that learn patterns to then generate content, make predictions, or complete classification tasks. Data annotation, processing, and evaluation are also key components of content moderation systems that filter out graphic, harmful, and hateful content from platforms. [3]</p>
            Understanding these data sets requires human, contextual understanding. This means humans sometimes interact with toxic, graphic and hateful content under already distressful and exploitative working conditions. <br>

            <b>5. Making the Rich Richer and the Poor Poorer</b><br>
            The godfather of AI, Geoffrey Hinton, stated that "AI will make a few people much richer, but most people poorer" [6]<br>
            The impact of AI on the global income distribution is highly uncertain. Howver, most predictions suggest it will increase inequality, both within-countries and between-countries. <br>
            It is predicted that AI will benefit highly skilled workers, and replace low-skilled jobs and repetitive tasks. Wealth will be concentrated among those who control the technology. <br>
            Catch-up growth of developing countries is threatened by AI. Because developing countries may not be able harness AI's benefits orm mitigate its disruptions, they will again fall far behind.
