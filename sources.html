                <br>Jan 17, 2025 (<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117" target="_blank">link</a>)
                <p>"By 2026, the electricity consumption of data centers is expected to approach 1,050 terawatt-hours" says Noman Bashir. [1]</p>
            <p>“The demand for new data centers cannot be met in a sustainable way. The pace at which companies are building new data centers means the bulk of the electricity to power them must come from fossil fuel-based power plants,” [1]</p>
            <p>“Just because this is called "cloud computing" doesn't mean the hardware lives in the cloud. Data centers are present in our physical world, and because of their water usage they have direct and indirect implications for biodiversity,” Bashir says. [1]</p>
            <p> Chilled water is used to cool a data center by absorbing heat from computing equipment. It has been estimated that, for each kilowatt hour of energy a data center consumes, it would need two liters of water for cooling, says Bashir. [1]</p>
            <p>"While all machine-learning models must be trained, one issue unique to generative AI is the rapid fluctuations in energy use that occur over different phases of the training process, Bashir explains. Power grid operators must have a way to absorb those fluctuations to protect the grid, and they usually employ diesel-based generators for that task." [1]</p>
